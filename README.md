## Node list

### CSVW Validator

This is the node(s) for reading a csv file and the corresponding metadata file as input and validating the csc file based on the [CSVW (CSV on the Web)](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/) standard.

#### Input

The input files should be stored either locally or in a publicly accessible remote origin (e.g. a public GitHub repo). Note that the files should be put together, and the metadata file should be named as `<csv-file-name.csv>-metadata.json`.
